#+TITLE: Typst Mode

An Emacs major mode for [[https://typst.app/][typst]], a markup-based typesetting system.

Since the language style of =typst= is somewhat complicated to parse(at least for me), currently this package  only provides limited syntax highlighting feature :( Maybe complicated cases should be implemented into lsp server?

* Requirements
[[https://github.com/typst/typst][typst]]

[[https://github.com/polymode/polymode][polymode]]

minium Emacs version hasn't been tested

* Current Features
** Functions
1. =typst-compile=  (default bind: =C-c C-c=)
2. =typst-preview= (default bind: =C-c C-p=)
3. =typst-toggle-watch= (default bind: =C-c C-w=; also provide =typst-watch= and =typst-stop-watch=)
** Style
*** Markup

| Character escape | ✓       | Tweet at us \#ad     |
| Comment          | ✓       | =/* block */, // line= |

* Customization
faces and custom variables with prefix =typst= or =typst-mode=

* To Dos
1. [ ] fix math mode 
2. [ ] code block highlight
3. [ ] add treesit mode

* Current Shortages
For those stuffs cannot be done in short future.
1. no syntax support for the context block =[ ]= which is located in the code block ={ }= \\
   this problem possibly can be solved with *nested polymode*. However, currently there is no official support for this function?
   
*As an Emacs Lisp novice, this is my first package. I greatly value your assistance, including issues, pull requests, and more!*
